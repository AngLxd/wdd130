            <p>Hi, my name is Angel Resendiz</p>
            <p>I graduated from Jackson Hole High school and currently a first semester freshman in college</p>
            <p>Majoring in Computer Science</p>
            <p>I used to live in McAllen,</p>
            <p>I later moved to Corpus Cristi and lived in there for 3 months,</p>
            <p>My family wanted to move to a quieter place and ended up moving to Jackson, WY</p>
            <p>I ended up getting really bored within a month living in jackson so I guess they are in the right place now lol</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">~Things About Me~</p>
